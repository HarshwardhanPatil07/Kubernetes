# Operator

- Example
![Stateless-Applications-on-k8s.png](/assets/Stateless-Applications-on-k8s.png)
- when updating just update deployment configuration and all replicas get restarted with new version (Control Loop)

- What happens in Stateful Application is that:
    - More "Hand-Holding" needed.
    - Throughout the lifecycle (kubernetes cannot do it )
    - All three replicas are different
    - Own State and identity of replicas
    - order important

- Therefore Manual operators are needed but it is not same as kubernetes, as kubernetes demand automation, self healing

## What is Operator?
- Replaces this human operator with software operator.  So it knows how to deploy the app. How to create the cluster of multiple replicas? How to recover when one replica fails.
- Tasks are automated and reusable.
- No manual managing (only 1 operator) (scalling)
## How does operator work?
![Operator-Work.png](/assets/Operator-Work.png) 
- Makes use of CRD's(Custom Resource Definitions) Custom k8s components(extends k8s api)
- domain app specific knowledge

## Who creates this operator?
- A team with domain specific knowledge - How to create mysql cluster, How to run it, How to synchronize data, how to update
- Ex. prometheus-operator, elastic-operator(elastic-search), mysql-operator, postgres-operator
