# Why automation via kubernetes(features)  and AWS ECS?

- manages the lifecycle of conatainer

- when you create ECS cluster you have control plane, you have control plane

## how does ecs works?
![ECS-working](/assets/ECS-working.png)
## which services are running on your EC2-instance
- Container runtime
- ECS agent - for control plane communication; control plane manages containers.
## ECS with EC2
![ECS-with-EC2](/assets/ECS-with-EC2.png)
- Manages the container
- Full access and control of your infrastructure

# ECS with Fargate (Delegate Infrastructure management also to AWS??ðŸ¤”)
- Alternative to EC2-instances
- Severless way to launch conatiners
    - "Severless" meaning: No server in your AWS account. It is managed by AWS.
- No need to provision and manage servers
- provision a server on demand.
- Pay only for what you use (only the infrastructure resources needed to run your containers)
- Easily scales without fixed resources
- you only need to manage your application
## AWS fargate pricing?
- How long?
- how much capacity?

# What if you want to use kubernetes with AWS??
- Yes, you can use EKS (Alternative of ECS)
- EKS deploys and manages kubernetes control plane nodes 
- k8s control plane service already installed on them.
## why prefer over ECS??
- You already use k8s
- kubernetes is open source
- Easier to migrate to other platform
- Large community(ex. helm charts)
## why ecs??
- Less complex
- ECS control plane is free

# Amazon ECR
- Repository for Docker Images
- Alternative to Docker Hub, Nexus
- Integrates well with AWS Services
