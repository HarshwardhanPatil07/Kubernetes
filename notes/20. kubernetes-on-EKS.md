# EKS (147)
![Steps-to-create-eks](/assets/Steps-to-create-eks.png)

# 1. EKS IAM Role
- 1. go to IAM -> select AWS Service, in USE CASE select EKS from dropdown, EKS cluster -> Create role

# 2. VPC
## why do we need specific networking configuration?
- EKS cluster needs specific networking configuration
- k8s specific and networking specific networking rules
- Default VPC not optimized for it.

#
- Each vpc has subnets and each subnet has it's firewall rules which are configured by NACl
- Inside subnet you have EC2- instances and instances also has their own firewall rules which are defined by security groups

- Best Practice: configure public and private subnets
- Through IAM you give kubernetes permission to change VPC configurations
- Instead of creating VPC manually we can use template from CloudFormation.
## 3. cloudformation
- click create stack -> template is ready ,Amazon s3 -> in AWS documentation of EKS you have 3 options -- only private subnets, only public subnets, public and private subnets. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/creating-a-vpc.html

- copy ipv4 of public and private subnet -> if want to configure template, paste url in browser yaml file gets downloaded, else go on paste the url in Amazon s3 url section -> click next -> name the stack - eks-worker-node-vpc-stack -> next -> again next -> submit

- Select output you will need this 3 information when creating the EKS cluster (Control Plane)

- Now serch EKS -> you will be charged for EKS -> Add cluster -> name- eks-cluster-test, version- 1.27, eks-cluster-role from dropdown, you can enrypt your Secrets file via on button in KMS. -> next -> select vpc in dropdown which you created "eks-worker-node-vpc-stack", select security grp of newly created same -> 
- API server is the entrypoint to the cluster, choose public and private -> nxt -> nxt -> -> nxt  -> nxt -> create

# 4. connecting locally 
```bash

AWS configure list
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name eks-cluster-test

cat .kube/config
```

- in compute you will see this

# 5. create ec2 IAM role for node group
![eks-kubelet-Nodegroup](/assets/eks-kubelet-Nodegroup.png)
- So, kubelet on Worker Node (EC2 Instance) needs permission
- create role for Node Group that will allow worker processes like kubelet to perform actions

- Go search IAM -> Roles -> Use case select EC2 -> we need three policies
1. AmazonEKSWorkerNodePolicy
2. AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryReadOnly
3. EKS_CNI_Policy -> nxt
- name- eks-node-group-role

# Create Node group and Atach EKS cluster
- In compute of cluster info
- EKS -> Clusters -> eks-cluster-test -> name- eks-node-group -> select the node-group role just created, instance types- t3.small, node grp scaling configuration desired size-3.. minimum size-2.. max-4 -> nxt -> select key pair to connect locally, All -> submit

- After submit it will create 3 ec2 instances automatically
