# Introduction
- Serverless - no EC2 instances in our AWS account.
- 1 pod per virtual machine

# Limitations while using Fargate
- No support for stateful applications yet
- No support for DaemonSets yet

## Need to create role so that fargate can provision

- Go to IAM roles-> select EKS -> Fargate pod in Use case -> name- eks-fargate-role -> nxt

- Now go on EKS cluster Compute -> Fargate Profile

- -> nxt -> create
## Use Case of Having both the NodeGroup and Fargate in EKS
![fargate-use-case-eks](/assets/fargate-use-case-eks.png)
- another Use case is use both because of fargate limitations of only having stateless app. use NodeGroup for Stateful Apps.
