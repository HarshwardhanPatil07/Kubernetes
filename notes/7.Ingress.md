# Ingress - Connecting to Applications Outside Cluster



Ingress allows the application to have a simple and secure endpoint, like `https://my-app.com/`.

Ingress needs an implementation, which is called Ingress Controller.

## Installing Ingress Controller in minikube:

```bash
# automatically starts k8s nginx implementation of Ingress Controller
minikube addons enable ingress

# check if it's running fine:
kubectl get pod -n kube-system
```
## kubernetes-dashboard
**UPDATE**: apparently the example below doesn't work anymore. The kubernetes-dashboard can be accessed via minikube dashboard (which is not really a good Ingress config exercise).

- In minikube cluster kubernetes-dashboard already exists out-of-the-box, but not accessible externally. Let's configure it to be accessible.
```bash
# check if it's running
kubectl get all -n kubernetes-dashboard
```

Create `dashboard-ingress.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: dashboard-ingress
  namespace: kubernetes-dashboard
spec:
  rules:
  - host: dashboard.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
        serviceName: kubernetes-dashboard
        servicePort: 80
```

Back to terminal:

```bash
kubectl apply -f dashboard-ingress.yaml

# check if it's running
kubectl get ingress -n kubernetes-dashboard

# if the ADDRESS is not visible yet, use the --watch option
kubectl get ingress -n kubernetes-dashboard --watch

# get the ADDRESS and edit your /etc/hosts
echo "${IP_ADDRESS}  dashboard.com" | sudo tee /etc/hosts

# open "http://dashboard.com/" in your browser
```

---

## Multiple paths for the same host



```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: simple-fanout-example
  annotations:
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /analytics
        backend:
          serviceName: analytics-service
          servicePort: 3000
      - path: /shopping
        backend:
          serviceName: shopping-service
          servicePort: 8080
```

---

## Multiple sub-domains or domains


Multiple hosts with 1 path. Each host represents a subdomain.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: name-virtual-host-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: analytics.myapp.com
    http:
      paths:
        backend:
          serviceName: analytics-service
          servicePort: 3000
  - host: shopping.myapp.com
    http:
      paths:
        backend:
          serviceName: shopping-service
          servicePort: 8080
```

## Configuring TLS Certificate


You only need this in your ingress yaml file:

```yaml
# ...
spec:
  tls:
  - hosts:
    - myapp.com
    secretName: myapp-secret-tls
    # and, of course, have a Secret with
    # that name in the same namespace
```


![k8s-tls-certificate.png](/assets/k8s-tls-certificate.png)

**NOTES:**

1. data keys need to be `tls.crt` and `tls.key`
2. values of those keys are actual file contents, not file paths
3. Secret component must be in the same namespace as the Ingress component
