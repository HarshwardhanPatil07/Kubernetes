# microservices

- Can be developed, deployed, and managed independently

- each business functionality is encapsulated into own Microservice (MS)
- smaller independent application
- changes in one MS don't affect other
- less interconnected logic
## how do microservices communicate? - 3 types
- Service-to-Service API calls ex. Code in user service send API request to messenger service.
- Message based communition, uses message broker to communicate all request goes from broker    
- Service-Mesh, instead of one single message broker ex. Istio
