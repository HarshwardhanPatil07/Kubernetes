### What is a Service and why do we need it?

"The Service component is an abstraction layer that basically represents an IP address"

- Each Pod has its own IP address
    - Pods are ephemeral - destroyed frequently

**Service:**
- has a stable IP address
- does load balancing
- loose coupling
- able to communicate within & outside the cluster

**4 (or 3) types of Services:**
- ClusterIP (default)
- Headless (actually a subtype of ClusterIP)
- NodePort
- LoadBalancer

### ClusterIP Services

- aka Internal Service

- default type

- How the Service knows to which Pod it needs to forward the request to?
    - Pods are identified via selectors
    - key value pairs
    - labels of pods
    - you can give any name you want

**If a Pod has several ports open, how the service knows to which port to forward the request to?**
- `targetPort` Service attribute

**Service Endpoints**
- Kubernetes creates Endpoint objects. They have the same name as the Service and keep track of which Pods are the members/endpoints of the Service.

```bash
kubectl get endpoints
```

**Service Communication: port vs targetPort**
- The service port is arbitrary (choose anything you want)
- The targetPort must match the port the Pod is listening at.

**Multi-Port Services**

### Headless Services

**13min**

- It's a way to allow pods to be accessed directly.
- Useful for pods running stateful applications (like databases)
- Apparently it's a subtype of the ClusterIP service.
- It's declared like this:

```yaml
# ...
kind: Service
# ...
spec:
  clusterIP: None
# ...
```

- And you can see it in the output of `kubectl get services`, in the line where the column `CLUSTER-IP` says `None`.

### NodePort Services

**17:35**

- creates a service that is accessible on a static port on each worker node in the cluster
- a NodePort service is able to receive connections from outside the cluster
- `nodePort` attribute must be between `30000 - 32767`
- when you create a NodePort service, a ClusterIP service is automatically created
- **NOT SECURE!!** It exposes the Nodes to the "external world"

**??? DOUBT ???**
- what's the difference between NodePort and LoadBalancer?
- what's the usecase for NodePort?

### LoadBalancer Services

- LoadBalancer makes the Service become accessible externally.
- automatically creates a NodePort and a ClusterIP services.
- it's an extension of NodePort (and NodePort is an extension of ClusterIP).

### Wrap-Up

- NodePort service is NOT for external connection.
- configure Ingress or LoadBalancer for production environments
