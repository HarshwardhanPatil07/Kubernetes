# Best Practices

## 1. Pinned (Tag) Version for each Container Image
- Why no version not recommended

- Makes it unpredictable

- Might break something

- Which versions are currently deployed in the cluster is not transparent

# 2. Configure a liveness probe on each container
## Why it's important

- K8s manages its resources intelligently

- Restarts Pods when it crashes

- Pod runs, but application inside is not in a healthy state

## Solution??
- Perform Health Checks with Liveness Probe

- Adjust the port number acc to microservice

# 3. Readiness Probe for each container

## Why it's important

- Perform Health Checks with Readiness Probe

- Let's K8s know if application is ready to receive traffic

- Without readiness probe, K8s assumes the app is ready to receive traffic as soon as the container starts

- In Redis use tcpSocket instead of trpc as it checks connection.
- `HTTP Probes` kubelet sends an HTTP request to specified path and port.
```bash
livenessProbe:
    httpGet:
        path: /health
        port: 3550
    periodSeconds: 5 
readinessProbe:
    grpc:
        port: 3550
    periodSeconds: 5 
```

# 4. Resource Requests for each container
- 2 Types of resources: CPU and Memory, CPU resources are defined in "millicores" (m), Memory resources are defined in bytes.. mebibyte(Mi)

- Requests is what the container is guaranteed to get

- K8s Scheduler uses this to figure out where to run the Pods
```bash
readinessProbe:
    grpc:
        port: 8080
    periodSeconds: 5
resources:
    requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 64Mi
```
# 5. Don't Expose a NodePort

# 6. More than one replica for deployment
no single point of failure
# 7. Use more than 1 Worker Node
# 8. Using Labels
Custom identifier for your components
# 9. Using Namespace

# Security best practices
## 1. Ensure Images are free from vulnerabilities
- Third party libraries with vulnerabilities
- Base image with vulnerablities
## Sol?
- Manual Vulnerability scan, Automated vulnerability scan in build pipeline
## 2. No root access container
```bash
spec: 
    containers:
        - name: app
          image: nginx:1.25.2
          securityContext: 
           priviledged: true
```
- No true should be there
- with root access they have access to host-level resources
- If container hacked then lot of damage can be done
## 3. Update kubernetes to the latest version
- update k8s version Node by Node to avoid application Downtime
