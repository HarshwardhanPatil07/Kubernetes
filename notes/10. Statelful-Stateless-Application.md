# Kubernetes StatefulSet Notes

* **Definition**: StatefulSet is a Kubernetes controller for managing stateful applications.
![StatefulSet.png](/assets/StatefulSet.png)
* **Stateful vs. Stateless**

  * *Stateful apps*: Store and track data (e.g., MySQL, Elasticsearch, MongoDB).
  * *Stateless apps*: Do not retain previous interactions; each request is independent (e.g., Node.js front-end).

* **Deployment Components**

  * *Stateless*: Use **Deployment** to scale interchangeable Pods with random names and shared Service.
  * *Stateful*: Use **StatefulSet** to manage Pods with **sticky identities** and individual storage.

* **Key Differences**

  1. **Pod Identity**:

     * Deployment Pods get random hashes.
     * StatefulSet Pods have stable, ordinal names (`name-0`, `name-1`, ...).
  2. **Creation & Deletion Order**:

     * StatefulSet creates/deletes Pods sequentially (0 → N; N → 0).
  3. **Storage**:

     * Each Pod has its own PersistentVolume.
     * Volumes persist beyond Pod lifecycle.
  4. **Networking**:

     * Each Pod gets a unique DNS endpoint in addition to the shared Service.

## 2 characteristics
     1. Prdictable pod name
     2. fixed individual DNS name
**when Pod Resets:**
- IP Address change
- Name and End point stay same (sticky identity)

## Why Database Identity?

* **Scaling Behavior (in general)**

  1. New replica clones data from the previous Pod and joins sync.
  2. Only one Pod (the “main”) writes data; others act as read-only replicas.

* **Data Persistence**

  * Use remote PersistentVolumes to ensure storage survives Pod/node failures.
  * Recommended even if replication exists, to prevent total data loss.

* **Best Practices**

  * Configure data synchronization (e.g., replication, clustering) within the application.
  * Provision and manage remote storage manually (StatefulSet does not handle backup).


-- in Stateful deletion or scale down to 1 starts from last pod mysql-3 and then mysql-2 gets deleted i.e. **deletion in reverse order**

-- stateful applications are not a perfect candidate for containerized environment. 
-- Stateful applications are not a perfect candidate for containerized environments. 
-- In fact, Docker, Kubernetes and generally containerization is perfectly fitting for stateless applications that do not have any state and data dependency, and only process code, so scaling and replicating them in containers is super easy.
